# Lab: Play with React Components
Let's work with Components

## In this lab you will accomplish the following:
 - Understand how ReactDOM.render() works
 - Learn what JSX is
 - Understand how to use properties and state to make a React Component
 
## Set up your environment
 - This lab already contains the configuration files (package.json, webpack.config.js, .babelrc) that was created [in this guide](https://github.com/kayashaolu/webarch/blob/master/md/w-setup-react-environment.md)
 - The src/index.js and src/index.html files have already been created
 - In order to activate this environment, you will need to redownload the node_modules from the package.json file
 - Run `npm install` to install the node packages
 - Run `npm start` to start your webserver
 - This should be it: you can make all of your changes in the src/index.js file and your main 
 
## You are tasked with the following:
1. Create a React Component called "Add" that takes two properties: op1 and op2 and in it's render function wraps the answer in a div.

2. Create a second React Component called "Subtract" that takes two properties: op1 and op2 and in it's render function wraps the answer in a div.

The index.js file provided will have code that will test the two above components. Ensure that it works as expected
